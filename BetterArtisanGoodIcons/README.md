# Better Artisan Good Icons


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2080?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod overwrites the corresponding draw functions for artisan goods using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), and then draws the right texture for them based on what was used to make them.
