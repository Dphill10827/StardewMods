# Flowery Tools


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6203) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

For most of the tools the mod inspects the animation frames the player is currently going through. Certain sets of frames correspond uniquely to certain animations, so based on the frames being shown different flower patterns are added.

Some tool actions don't work through animations (e.g. tools charging, the bobber landing, slingshots firing) so these are special-cased to add flowers for.
