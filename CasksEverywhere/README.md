# Casks Everywhere


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2994) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod transpiles the cask function to check if items can be placed in it to allow any location, thereby not needing to handle custom item serialization.
