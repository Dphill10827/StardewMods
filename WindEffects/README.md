# Wind Effects


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6647?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod generates sin curves to represent gusts of wind. These are spawned just outside the player's view and travel across the map until they go out of bounds.

As the waves travel, they report the tiles they touch. Those tiles are then shaken, providing the effect!

Run `we debug` in the console and click around a bit to spawn some waves, and see the internal representation the waves have if you're curious.
