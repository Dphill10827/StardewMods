# Better Slingshots


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2067?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod works by Harmony patching various `Slingshot` methods to achieve the desired features. Unlike the old version of the mod, this completely rewritten approach is multiplayer compatible because it doesn't swap out `Slingshot` instances as the player uses them (which lead to a ton of errors).
