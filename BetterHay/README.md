# Better Hay


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1430?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod has two parts:
- Collect Hay Without Silos: If you have no silos or they're full, the mod simulates the relevant hay drop code as if you did.
- Pull Hay out of Hoppers Anytime: The mod replaces the existing Hoppers with new ones that allow you to withdraw hay whenever.
