# Stack Everything


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2053?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

This mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to:
 - replace `StardewValley.Object.maximumStackSize` to always return 999.
 - postfix `StardewValley.Object.drawInMenu` to correctly draw the stack number.
 - replace `StardewValley.Object.getStack` to return the correct stack amount.
 - replace `StardewValley.Object.addToStack` to add items correctly.
 - replace `DecoratableLocation.removeQueuedFurniture` to not overwrite items when picking up furniture with a full inventory.
 - replace `Item.canStackWith` to prevent dressers with items from stacking and items being lost.

It also replaces placed down tappers and furniture into new instances of those items so there isn't the same instance of the same item in multiple locations.
