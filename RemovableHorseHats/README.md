# Removable Horse Hats


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2223?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to overwrite the horse's `checkAction` method to instead remove the hat the horse is wearing if it is wearing one and the player is holding down the activation key.
