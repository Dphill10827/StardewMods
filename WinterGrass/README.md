# Winter Grass


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1601?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod saves grass to a file during the transition to and every day of winter, and then adds it back into the game when a new save is loaded.
