# Mod Update Menu


See [This link](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2536/) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

Adds a menu to the title screen accessible by a new button which displays info about mod status. Mod updates are taken from the update checks SMAPI does.
