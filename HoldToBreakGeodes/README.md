# Hold To Break Geodes


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1689?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod resends left click events to the geode breaking window every certain period of time if you hold down the mouse button.
