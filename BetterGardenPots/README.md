# Better Garden Pots


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2209?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to overwrite various `IndoorPot` methods to achieve different results based on the configuration settings the user has specified.

Note that this repo does not contain the Harmony dll, and the ones found in the mentioned link are not compiled targeting .NET 4.5. You'll need to compile for .NET 4.5 yourself, or just copy the dll packaged in the release.
