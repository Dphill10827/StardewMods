# Better Fruit Trees


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1976) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod has three parts:
- Better Fruit Tree Placement: The mod places down a fruit tree if the player was unable to due to other tree restrictions.
- Fruit Trees Grow Even With Debris: The mod simulates a day of growth if the game didn't due to other tree restrictions.
- Junimos Harvest Fruit Trees: The JunimoHut and JunimoHarvester classes are replaced with new ones that are also aware of fruit trees and know how to harvest them.
