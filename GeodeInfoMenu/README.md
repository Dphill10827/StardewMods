# Geode Info Menu


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1448?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

Geode drops are predetermined, so the mod displays that info with other useful features like search and missing artifacts, in a custom created window.
