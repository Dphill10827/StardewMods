# Winter Grass


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1601?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod Harmony patches various grass methods to cause it to not die in winter and optionally not grow. This new approach saves grass like normal in the main save file - it no longer requires a separate save file making updates easy. The mod also automatically converts old save files to the new format.
