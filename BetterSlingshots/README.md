# Better Slingshots


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2067?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod works by dynamically replacing the `Slingshot` the player is holding with my own `BetterSlingshot` when they go to fire it, and then doing the opposite when the player stops firing it. `BetterSlingshot` handles all the changes, and this way we don't need to worry about any custom items in the save file.
