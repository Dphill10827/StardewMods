# Custom Transparency


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2359?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to transpile the methods which control the minimum transparency setting (which is hardcoded to 0.4) to what the user specifies.
