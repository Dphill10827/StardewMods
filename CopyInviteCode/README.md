# Copy Invite Code


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2171) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## Abandoned

This mod will no longer receive updates. This exact functionality was added to SDV in version 1.3.17, so the mod is no longer needed.

## How it works

This is a small mod that detects when the invite code menu is active, and then replaces the usual `ConfirmationDialog` close button with a button that instead extracts and saves the invite code to the user's clipboard. This works because the close button isn't used by the game.
